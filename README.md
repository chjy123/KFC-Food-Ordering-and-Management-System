# KFC-Food-Ordering-and-Management-System

# System Description
Presently, KFC uses paper menu, oral reception of order and hand written bill both on take away and dine in transactions. This manual process is a continuous source of incorrect orders, long service period and restrictions on visibility of the order process.

A theoretical system which is web based would aim at substituting these manual processes with a virtual menu in which, structured in categories, is shown to the customers to navigate items, use a shopping bag, take orders, make virtual payments, and leave reviews. Meanwhile, administrators will have an opportunity to view or delete menu items, menu categories, track live orders, update their statuses, and reviews regardless of whether an option is selected by the customer or not.

The system aims at eliminating the errors of order, speeding up the service, centralizing the customer reviews, and providing the customers and administrators with effective and open operations.
